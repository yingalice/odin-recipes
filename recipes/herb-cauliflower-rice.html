  <h2>Description</h2>
  
  <p><em>Time: 20 minutes</em></p>

  <p>Herb cauliflower rice is a delicious guilt-free side dish!  Cauliflower is low carb, high in vitamins and fiber, and a good source of antioxidents.  Cauliflower by itself is pretty boring, but kick it up a notch by adding butter, garlic, fresh herbs, and fresh lemon juice, and you get a herby flavor explosion!  Then sprinkle almond slices to introduce some extra crunch and texture.  Yum!</p>

  <p>Tip: I prefer to use store bought cauliflower rice, as it was too much trouble and messy to cut it into tiny pieces.  But if you do opt to make your own, you can always store extras in the freezer for 1-2 months.</p>
